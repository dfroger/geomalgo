    cdef class Triangulation2D:
        cdef get(Triangulation2D self, int I, CTriangle2D* T)

to:
    cdef get(Triangulation2D self, CTriangle2D* T, int I)

    small and numerous object need a Cython API
    Triangulation2D is a big object:
        - no need for Cython API, except for dealing with its small parts
          (iterator)
        - no assumption how it should be organized:
          - simple class with only x, y, trivtx
          - comutational functions

    Cython API for speed
    Python API for large object, doc, prototyping, learning...
    easy to switch from one to another
